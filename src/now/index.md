title: What I'm up to

Right now I'm wrapping up the initial release of this site. I'll probably share my process, tech stack, etc, in a blog post.

In the meantime, my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/naheller/nate-spot) has all the raw materials presented without commentary. There's a bunch I still want to do, but for the moment I'll step back and spend some time on other projects.

Other things:

- **Currently reading:** Fool Moon - Jim Butcher
- **Currently listening:** Clearing The Path To Ascend - YOB
- **Recent metal show:** Rivers of Nihil w/ Inter Arma
- **Recent horror movie:** Bring Her Back
